## About The Project

This project was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This solo project is part of Turing Software and Designs' Front-End Program, Module 3. The project focuses on creating an original application using React. It implements ES6 syntax and Router into our React application. One database was accessed, representing a large chunk of data for random activities a user could do. The database is accessed with and without parameters. My task was to create an application that gave the user random activities to do during quarantine. Each activity contains a type, number of participants, price, and key (for verification). This program also incorporates the use of the React/Jest testing libraries.
